# ti99-c99

This is a port of Clint Pulley's C99 compiler for the Texas Instruments
TI-99 and related home computers, adapted from Ron Cain's Small-C.
It implements a subset of C from the 1980s + TI-99 extensions such
as embedded TMS9900 assembly language, and should not be confused with
the C99 ISO standard.

The C99 compiler was designed to run on the TI-99, alongside the
Editor/Assembler system.  This is an adaptation of the code by Kristine
Rogers for cross-compiling on Unix or DOS systems.  See readme.txt for
notes on the porting effort.
