# ti99-c99

This is a port of Clint Pulley's C99 compiler for the Texas Instruments TI-99 and related home computers,
adapted from Ron Cain's Small-C.  It implements a subset of C from the 1980s and should
not be confused with the C99 ISO standard.

The C99 compiler runs on the TI-99.  This is an adaptation of the code by Kristine Rogers for
cross-compiling on Unix or DOS systems.  See readme.txt for notes on the porting effort.
